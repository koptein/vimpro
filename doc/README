INTRODUCTION
===
This is vimpro - ViM Project management. It only includes a basis and an upload script yet.

DEPENDENCIES
===
bash and ncftp (with ncftpput)

INSTALLATION
===
- Put vimup.sh in $PATH
- create .vimpro in $HOME and put plist and the sample config in in (see doc/samples/)
- modify .vimrc in $HOME and add this line which binds upload on F5:
		map <F5> :w<CR>:silent<CR>:!vimup.sh "$(pwd)/%"<CR>
- modify the project-config (see testprj.conf)
- open a file within your configured project and press F5 in command mode

LIMITATIONS
===
Copying Files in scp mode relies on the scp comand that comes with the standard ssh packages
Due to the fact that scp does not accept a password as an argument scp mode only works with 
ssh-keys in place
